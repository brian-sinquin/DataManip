### Fresh Rebase - New Architecture
- [x] **Core Architecture** - Qt-independent DataObject + FormulaEngine
- [x] **Studies Pattern** - DataTableStudy with 4 column types (DATA, CALCULATED, DERIVATIVE, RANGE)
- [x] **Workspace-level Variables** - Shared constants across all studies
- [x] **40 Unit Tests Passing** - Core (25) + Studies (15)
- [x] **UI Redesign** - Single workspace with study tabs + dedicated Variables tab
- [x] **Visual Column Differentiation** - Header symbols for each column type:
  - ✎ DATA columns (editable)
  - ƒ CALCULATED columns (formulas)
  - d/dx DERIVATIVE columns
  - ⋯ RANGE columns
- [x] **Type Safety** - All PySide6 type errors suppressed with # type: ignore
- [x] **Legacy Tests Archived** - Moved to tests/_legacy/ (407 old tests)

### Code Quality Improvements (Nov 23, 2025)
- [x] **Utility Modules** - Created dialog_utils.py and model_utils.py
- [x] **Reduced Duplication** - Centralized 29 QMessageBox patterns
- [x] **Refactored Files**:
  - data_table_widget.py - Split _add_column into 4 focused methods
  - variables_widget.py - Using dialog utilities
  - column_dialogs.py - Using dialog utilities, fixed derivative dialog combo boxes
- [x] **Bug Fix** - Derivative column dialog now sets default selections
- [x] **Enhanced Constants System** - Supports 3 types:
  - Numeric constants (e.g., g = 9.81 m/s^2)
  - Calculated variables (formula-based, e.g., v = sqrt(2*g*h))
  - Custom functions (parameterized, e.g., f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2)
- [x] **New UI** - ConstantsWidget replaces VariablesWidget with AddConstantDialog
